**This is my assignment of Principle of Programming Languages which contains 4 assignments.** 

This programming language is named **Micro C**.  A statement from MC documentation provided from my teacher: "**MC (Micro C) is a language which consists of a subset of C plus some Java language fea- tures.**"

In **assignment 1**, we used [ANTLR](https://www.antlr.org/) to implement a lexer and a recognizer for a programming language. 

**Assignment 2**, we used Python and some support class already written by my teacher to  *generate intermediate code* (**Abstract Syntax Tree**). 

**Assignment 3**

 - We wrote a Static Check
 - Like other languages, we can compile it, it must have no errors and if we have any errors like: Not declared variable, function not define or duplicate declaration. If it does, the error will throw. 

I think Assignment 3 is the most complicated in our assignment. If you grasp of 3 assignments. I definitely believe you will easily complete assignment 4. 

**Assignment 4**

 - We  implement a code generation phase for a stack-based-machine like JVM. 
 - create a complete compiler for JVM
 
 A lot of ados :)), from assignment 2 to 4, we used **Python3** to implement it. 

For your information, I receive **9.8/10** on average of 4 assignments. For particular **Assignment 1** and **Assignment 2**, I received a **10/10** grade.  You can trust this source code if you beleive it. 

Documentations for the particular assignment, I already uploaded, you can refer to it for more detail.
